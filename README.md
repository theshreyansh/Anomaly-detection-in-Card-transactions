# Anomaly detection in Card transactions
<p>Domain: Finance & Risk Analytics</p>
<p>Skills: Cluster Analysis, R, TABLEAU, Time Series Analysis, Classification</p>
<p>Description: <li>To find the anomaly transactions from the bank dataset . Anomalies can be based on the merchant category codes, transaction amount or frequency of transactions occurring repeatedly from the same card.</li>
<li>With the Clustering method we did not find anything significant for the anomaly transactions and MCC code as anomalies occur rarely, while with the data analysis we found 2 outlier transactions on MCC code. Time series forecasting, our mean square error 29.8% for Exponential Moving Average(EMA). Hence Exponential Moving Average is a better fit model for forecasting for rate anomaly.</li></p>
